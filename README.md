# Calgary-Transit-Reborn
Maps and resources from my proposal for an overhaul of public transit in Calgary

## Rationale
I am in the progress of writing a report describing the rationale for this system. It's still a WIP but you can see it here at:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SyxgfXDGrWfLdb-O2y3Dr1Dh2Pc6roHdbGsgMLN4z3Q/edit?usp=sharing. 

## Getting Involved
If you want to contribute to this project, please reach out to me at joel.happ1@ucalgary.ca. You are also invited to create GitHub issues if you just have small ideas, concerns, or suggestions!

I am particularly interested in getting in touch with people with the following skillsets:
- Video editing
- Transit/transportation planning
- Urban planning
- Sketching / creating concept art

I can also be reached via LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/joel-happ/ or twitter at https://twitter.com/JoelHapp

## The Map
For best viewing experience, download the map and use a photo editor or viewing software. This map is too large for most computer screens or pieces of paper, but could be very legible on larger billboards at transit stations.

## How can I edit the maps?
Every map and resource here is a .pdn file. To edit them, you'll need Paint.NET on your computer. [You can install Paint.NET here](https://www.getpaint.net/download.html#download),
but be careful to download the right app, as the website contains ads disguised as download buttons.


Every route exists on a separate layer of the pdn map file. You can modify one route without changing any others. 
The station dots also exist on a separate layer, along with other things like planning layers, and alternative backgrounds. 


### Why are there different map sizes? Which should I use?

I use the medium map size for all route changes and creating new stations. I will regenerate the large map when necessary from the medium map.
You can resize the map by using a 150% Image Resize with the Super Sampling method.

The large map is where I add labels and text, because the medium map is too small for it. 

### How can I create new station dots?

The stationdot.pdn file contains everything you need to create stations. Here's the process I use:
1. Use the magic wand tool to select the area of the station dot I am interested in (e.x. the left third). There are layers with the exact outline you need.
2. Navigate to the layer with the color I want, ex. Red LRT
3. Copy (Ctrl+C)
4. Navigate to a new layer which will contain the dot I am currently creating
5. Paste, and repeat process for the other portions of the stationdot.

If you need to give stationdots a special outline to make them visible, I use the Glow Adjustment with the following settings: Radius 2, Brightness -100, Contrast 100
