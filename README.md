## Getting Involved

If you want to contribute to this project, please join our discord: https://discord.gg/UzACXw9yCe. You are also invited to create GitHub issues if you just have small ideas, concerns, or suggestions!

I am particularly interested in getting in touch with people with the following skillsets:

- Video editing
- Transit/transportation planning
- Urban planning
- Sketching / creating concept art

I can also be reached via LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/joel-happ/ or twitter at https://twitter.com/JoelHapp

## The Map

For best viewing experience, download the map and use a photo editor or viewing software. This map is too large for most computer screens or pieces of paper, but could be very legible on larger billboards at transit stations.

## How can I edit the maps?

Every map and resource here is a .pdn file. To edit them, you'll need Paint.NET on your computer. [You can install Paint.NET here](https://www.getpaint.net/download.html#download),
but be careful to download the right app, as the website contains ads disguised as download buttons.

Every route exists on a separate layer of the pdn map file. You can modify one route without changing any others.
The station dots also exist on a separate layer, along with other things like planning layers, and alternative backgrounds.
